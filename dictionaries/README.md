'dictionary1.txt' and 2 and 3 are the original 3 dictionaries
'combined dictionary.txt' is all of them combined

'filteredCombinedDict1.txt' removed special characters 
'filteredCombinedDict3.txt' removed capital letters

'filteredCombinedDict4.txt' removed words that are only repeating characters _like aaaaaaa or ffffffff_
'filteredCombinedDict4a.txt' removed duplicates and sorted via Microsoft Excel

'filteredCombinedDict5.txt' I used Microsoft Excel to remove the duplicates and sort it by alphabet
